The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column.

It is important to study the energy consuming behaviour in the residential sector and predict the energy consumption by home appliances as it consume maximum amount of energy in the residence. This project focuses on predicting the energy consumption of home appliances based on humidity and temperature.\n",
